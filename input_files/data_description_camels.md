Quantitative Summary of the Dataset

Dataset Structure and Size:

- **Galaxy-level DataFrame**: Contains 720,548 galaxies at \( z=0 \), each associated with one of 1,000 simulated catalogs. Each row includes 17 galaxy properties, the catalog index, and 6 cosmological/feedback parameters, for a total of 24 columns.
- **Catalog-level DataFrame**: Contains 1,000 rows (one per simulation run), each with the catalog index and the 6 cosmological/feedback parameters.

All columns are numerical, with no missing values. The galaxy-level data types are predominantly `float64`, with catalog parameters as `float32` or `float64`.

Parameter Ranges and Distributions:

- **Galaxy Properties**: 
  - Stellar mass (\( M_\mathrm{star} \)) ranges from \( 6.4 \times 10^7 \) to \( 3.2 \times 10^{12} \) \( M_\odot \), with a mean of \( 9.2 \times 10^9 \) \( M_\odot \).
  - Black hole mass (\( M_\mathrm{BH} \)) spans 0 to \( 1.9 \times 10^{10} \) \( M_\odot \).
  - Star formation rate (SFR) ranges from 0 to \( 975 \) \( M_\odot/\mathrm{yr} \), with a mean of 0.43 \( M_\odot/\mathrm{yr} \).
  - Other properties (e.g., gas mass, metallicities, kinematic and structural parameters) cover broad, physically plausible ranges.

- **Catalog Parameters**:
  - Matter density (\( \Omega_m \)): 0.10–0.50 (mean 0.30, std 0.12)
  - Power spectrum normalization (\( \sigma_8 \)): 0.60–1.00 (mean 0.80, std 0.12)
  - Feedback parameters:
    - SN wind energy per SFR (\( A_\mathrm{SN1} \)): 0.25–3.99 (mean 1.35, std 1.02)
    - SN wind speed (\( A_\mathrm{SN2} \)): 0.25–3.99 (mean 1.35, std 1.02)
    - AGN feedback energy per accretion (\( A_\mathrm{AGN1} \)): 0.50–2.00 (mean 1.08, std 0.43)
    - AGN kinetic mode ejection speed (\( A_\mathrm{AGN2} \)): 0.50–2.00 (mean 1.08, std 0.43)

All 1,000 catalogs are unique and span the full parameter space.

Galaxy Population and Binning:

- **Galaxies per Catalog**: The number of galaxies per catalog varies widely (e.g., from ~100 to over 1,500), with a broad, non-uniform distribution.
- **Stellar Mass Bins**:
  - Low (\( <10^9 M_\odot \)): 323,240 galaxies
  - Intermediate (\( 10^9–10^{10} M_\odot \)): 269,450 galaxies
  - High (\( >10^{10} M_\odot \)): 127,720 galaxies
- **SFR Bins**:
  - Low (\( <0.1 M_\odot/\mathrm{yr} \)): 420,290 galaxies
  - Intermediate (\( 0.1–1 M_\odot/\mathrm{yr} \)): 227,510 galaxies
  - High (\( >1 M_\odot/\mathrm{yr} \)): 72,750 galaxies

Mean properties (e.g., gas mass, metallicity, kinematics) increase systematically with both stellar mass and SFR.

Correlations and Relationships:

- **Strong Correlations**:
  - Stellar mass is strongly correlated with black hole mass (\( r=0.86 \)), total mass (\( r=0.76 \)), and maximum circular velocity (\( r=0.68 \)).
  - Black hole mass is also strongly correlated with total mass (\( r=0.84 \)).
  - Kinematic properties (e.g., \( V_\mathrm{max} \), \( \sigma_v \)) are highly correlated (\( r=0.96 \)).
  - Photometric bands (U, K, g) are very strongly correlated with each other (\( r>0.96 \)), as expected.

- **Moderate/Weak Correlations**:
  - SFR shows only weak correlation with stellar mass (\( r=0.10 \)), indicating a wide diversity of star formation activity at fixed mass.
  - Gas and stellar metallicities are only weakly correlated with mass and SFR, but show moderate correlation with each other.

- **Scatter Plots**:
  - The stellar mass–black hole mass relation shows a clear positive trend with significant scatter, consistent with observed scaling relations.
  - The stellar mass–SFR relation is broad, reflecting the diversity of galaxy types (quiescent and star-forming).

Feedback Parameters and Galaxy Properties

- The feedback parameters (\( A_\mathrm{SN1} \), \( A_\mathrm{SN2} \), \( A_\mathrm{AGN1} \), \( A_\mathrm{AGN2} \)) are (log)-uniformly and broadly sampled across the 1,000 catalogs, ensuring good coverage of the parameter space.
- The summary statistics by galaxy bins indicate that higher feedback parameters are associated with catalogs containing more massive and more actively star-forming galaxies, but the direct relationship is not immediately apparent from the summary statistics alone. Further, more targeted analysis (e.g., regression or partial correlation) would be required to disentangle the effects of feedback from those of mass and environment.
- The wide range and distribution of feedback parameters, together with the large sample size, make the dataset well-suited for investigating the impact of feedback on galaxy scaling relations, star formation quenching, and black hole growth.

Suitability and Richness for Research

- The dataset is exceptionally rich, with a very large number of galaxies spanning a wide range of physical properties and environments, and with each galaxy linked to a well-sampled set of cosmological and feedback parameters.
- The structure allows for both galaxy-level and catalog-level analyses, including the study of how global parameters affect galaxy populations.
- The broad and uniform sampling of feedback parameters is particularly valuable for constraining the role of feedback in galaxy evolution.
- The absence of missing data, the large dynamic range, and the detailed binning/statistics make this dataset highly suitable for a wide range of research questions in galaxy formation and feedback physics.


**In summary:**  
This dataset provides a comprehensive, high-quality resource for exploring the interplay between cosmological/feedback parameters and galaxy properties, with sufficient statistical power and parameter coverage to robustly address key questions in galaxy evolution.
