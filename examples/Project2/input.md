The Final Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Success Rates dataset is part of the CDC’s National ART Surveillance System (NASS) and provides clinic-level success rate data for procedures conducted between 2020 and 2022. It includes information from U.S. fertility clinics on ART cycles, distinguishing whether patients used their own eggs or donor eggs, and whether ART was their first treatment or a follow-up. The dataset presents cumulative success rates (including embryo transfers over 12 months after retrieval) for own‑egg patients by retrieval and transfer, and non-cumulative rates for donor‑egg cycles. It also includes statistics like average transfers per retrieval and retrievals per live birth. These data—updated most recently in December 2024 and made public in early 2025—offer insights into clinic performance and national ART outcomes.

Among the dataset's relevant columns are:

ClinicID – unique identifier linking this Success Rates dataset to other ART data (Services, Characteristics, Summary) .

Reporting Year – the calendar year.

Age Group – patient age brackets (e.g., <35, 35–37, 38–40, etc.).

% Live Birth per Intended Retrieval – percentage of intended egg retrieval cycles resulting in live births within a year.

% Live Birth per Transfer – percentage of embryo transfer cycles resulting in live births within the same reporting window.

% Live Birth per Actual Retrieval – reflecting actual retrieval procedures conducted.

Avg Transfers per Intended Retrieval – average number of embryo transfers per intended retrieval.

Avg Intended Retrievals per Live-Birth – average number of retrieval cycles needed to yield a live birth.

Donor Egg Live Birth Rate – percentage of donor‑egg embryo transfer cycles leading to live births.

Clinic Export Variables – additional metrics such as clinic location, number of cycles, and whether it was first-time ART cycles.

These columns capture both performance and efficiency metrics, enabling comparisons across clinics and patient groups—own‑egg vs. donor‑egg, first‑time vs. any‑time ART, age categories, and aggregated national data.

The description of the columns, together with their data type is this:

The data is located here in /mnt/ceph/users/fvillaescusa/AstroPilot/Medicine/Fertility1/data/art_data_2020_2024.csv

Please come out with interesting ideas for a PhD student to analyze this data and learn some insight from it. Use state-of-the-art methods to analyze the data. For every step, make lots of plots and save the data you generate, as it may be used for other steps. When writing the code, write some lines to indicate whether the execution was successful or not. Join plots that are similar. Do not create dummy data. You have access to 128 cpus; for computationally heavy tasks, try to use all of them.
