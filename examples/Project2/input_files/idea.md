Efficiency and Performance Frontier Analysis of US ART Clinics (2020-2022) using Data Envelopment Analysis

This study proposes using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to assess the relative technical efficiency of U.S. ART clinics. Leveraging clinic-level data from the 2020-2022 NASS dataset for own-egg cycles, stratified by patient age group (<35, 35-37, etc.), the research will model the conversion of intended retrieval cycles (input) into live births (output, calculated from reported success rates and cycle counts). DEA will be performed for each year (2020, 2021, 2022) and age group to identify the efficiency frontier representing best practices and calculate efficiency scores for individual clinics relative to this frontier. The study will analyze the distribution of efficiency scores, benchmark clinics, and investigate temporal changes in efficiency over the three-year period.
